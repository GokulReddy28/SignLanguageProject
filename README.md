# 🖐️ AI-Based Gesture Analysis for Sign Language Translation  
🎯 *Empowering mute and hearing-impaired individuals using AI + Computer Vision*

---

## 🔥 Overview

This project aims to bridge the communication gap for **mute or hearing-impaired individuals** by converting **hand gestures (sign language) into text and speech in real time** using **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**.

📌 The system captures gestures via webcam → detects hand landmarks → classifies sign language → converts into readable text → optionally converts into speech.

This project demonstrates how technology can enable **inclusive communication** in education, healthcare, workplaces, and public spaces.
